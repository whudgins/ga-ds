# General Assembly Chicago Data Science - Winter 2015

## Course Description
Welcome to General Assembly's Chicago Data Science course! This is a foundational course in data science focusing on theory, applications, and real world problems. Students will learn multiple techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning in both regression and classification settings. In addition, students will gain the theoretical backbone for deciding which tools to use. Students will learn how to use the Pandas and scikit-learn packages in Python to build and validate their prediction models.

## Course Materials
Students are required to bring a laptop to every session with the [Continuum Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Python 2.7 distribution installed.


## Slack
You have all been invited to use Slack to chat throughout the day and in class. Please use Slack as the primary means to communicate, ask questions, and work with other students. If you have more questions, feel free to contact the staff through Slack as well.


## Workload
* Homework assignments will be listed on the github repo within the [homework](hw/) folder. Students must submit homeworks (i.e. ipython notebooks, PDFs, etc.) to gadschicago [at] gmail. The subject format should be [HW## - Student Name]. 
* In addition, there will be a [Final Project](extra/project.md).
* The project milestones will be treated as homeworks, and students are expected to submit them by beginning of class on the due dates.
* Due to the intensity and magnitude of the final project, less homework assignments will be given near the end of the course. This is to provide more time to work on the project. 


## Completion Requirements
Students must fulfill a number of requirements in order to receive General Assembly Letter of Completion in Data Science.
* Students must attend 80% of classes (no more than 4 classes missed)
* Students must complete and submit 80% of all course assignments to instructor satisfaction. Students wil receive timely feedback from staff.
* Students must successfully submit the course final project as outlined in the [Project Description](extra/project.md). This includes successfully submitting the project milestones, final technical paper, as well as delivering a final presentation.
* If you are having trouble with the homeworks and/or project, please communicate this with the team. We are here to help you learn and succeed.
